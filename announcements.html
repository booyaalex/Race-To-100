        Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! Welcome to the Blooket Race to 100 event! Over 11 rounds, players will race against each other and time to stay one step ahead of their opponents and cross the finish line in order to claim victory in this high stakes competition. Additionally, stump your opponents and gain the edge, because all sets in this event are created by partipants! So what are you waiting for? Rev up, hone your skills and sign up at bit.ly/RT100Signups now! Games begin in June and run through July. You must create a question set of at least 10 questions.
